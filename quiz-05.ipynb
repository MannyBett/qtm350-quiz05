    "Explain how you can use `pip` to manage dependencies in a Python project. Describe the process of generating a `requirements.txt` file from your current environment and how to use this file to install the same packages in another environment or on a different machine. Please comment your code to explain each step. It is not necessary to run the code, but you can if you want to test it. You can use the code cell below to write your answer."
